DEFINITION of 'Paper Wallet'

A paper wallet is an offline mechanism for storing coins. The process involves printing the private keys and TRX addresses onto paper. Paper wallet are considered one of the safest ways to store cryptocurrencies; if properly constructed, and provided that certain precautions are taken, it will be nearly impossible for a hostile user to access your holdings.

For maximum security we suggest to generate your paper wallet on an air gap computer. An air gap is a security measure to ensure that a computer is physically isolated from unsecured networks, such as the public Internet or an unsecured local area network.
